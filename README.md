# SkyLink Protocol (SKLP) ‚úàÔ∏è

This documentation offers insight into the SkyLink Protocol smart contracts (a framework for managing various aspects of an aircraft management system using blockchain technology). These contracts are designed to oversee functions such as aircraft data management, service record tracking, access control, and payments. They play a pivotal role within the broader SkyLink platform, a concept derived from the SkyLink Protocol Litepaper.

For a deeper understanding of the SkyLink Protocol and its intricate workings, I recommend delving into the Litepaper.

While these contracts have been crafted to support the realization of the SkyLink platform concept, there are currently no intentions for its complete development or deployment. Rather, these smart contracts are provided as an initial step for individuals or entities who wish to delve into or expand upon the SkyLink Protocol concept. Interested parties have the option to embrace these contracts as a cornerstone for crafting their unique aviation-oriented solutions on EVM-compatible blockchains.

## üí° Introduction

The smart contracts provided in this repository offer a versatile framework for managing various aspects of an aircraft management system using blockchain technology. Below are potential use cases for these smart contracts:

1. **Aircraft Management:** These contracts can be used to create and manage aircraft records. Airlines, aircraft leasing companies, and aviation enthusiasts can utilize this protocol to maintain a comprehensive database of aircraft. Information such as registration numbers, manufacturers, models, production dates, seat capacities, and ownership history can be securely recorded on the blockchain.

2. **Aircraft Component Tracking:** The smart contracts enable the tracking of aircraft components, such as engines, avionics, and more. Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) organizations can employ this system to record component details, including names, identifiers, manufacturers, and production dates. Additionally, the status of these components, whether in service or out of service, can be monitored in real-time.

3. **Ownership and Transfer:** These contracts facilitate the transfer of aircraft ownership. When an aircraft changes hands, the blockchain records the transaction, including the previous and current owners. This feature is valuable for documenting ownership changes accurately and transparently.

4. **Service Records:** Service records for both aircraft and components can be logged on the blockchain. Maintenance service providers (MROs) can use this functionality to create detailed service records, including information about the performer, service date, results, descriptions, and the list of serviced components.

5. **Access Control and Permissions:** The contracts include an access control system that allows the assignment of different roles, such as SUPER, MANUFACTURER, MRO, and THIRD_PARTY. This feature is essential for managing who can interact with the smart contracts and perform specific actions.

6. **Fees and Payments:** The Protocol supports fee management, with different fee classes (A, B, and C) that can be set and modified as needed. Actors can make payments using Ether to access specific features or perform actions within the platform.

Overall, these smart contracts provide a robust foundation for building a blockchain-based aircraft management system. They offer transparency, security, and traceability for various stakeholders within the aviation industry, including airlines, lessors, MROs, and regulatory authorities. Additionally, the contracts can be customized and extended to suit specific business requirements in the aviation sector.
